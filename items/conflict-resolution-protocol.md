This document outlines our Conflict Resolution Protocol for this project.

1. Member Failing to Meet Plan or Deadlines 
In the event that a team member fails to meet the initial project plan or deadlines, the following steps will be taken:
   1. The team member should promptly communicate the reason for the delay to the group.  
   2. The team should collectively assess the impact of the delay on the project timeline and overall deliverables.
   3. If necessary, the team will work collaboratively to revise the project plan and adjust deadlines while ensuring an equitable distribution of tasks and responsibilities.

2. Group Conflict and Consensus Building
When conflicts arise within the team that cannot be resolved through informal discussions, the following procedure will be followed:
    1. Group members involved in the conflict should express their concerns and viewpoints respectfully and constructively.
    2. If resolution is not achieved through direct communication, the matter will be escalated to the group leader. 
    3. The group leader will facilitate a discussion among all involved parties to identify the underlying issues and work towards consensus.
    4. If consensus remains elusive, the group leader will consult with the course instructor or teaching assistant to make a final decision in the best interest of the assignment.

3. Member Illness or Unforeseen Incidents
   To address situations where a team member is unable to work due to illness or other unforeseen incidents, the following steps will be taken:
    1. The affected group member should notify the team and the group leader as soon as possible. 
    2. The group leader, in consultation with the group, will evaluate the impact on project progress and deadlines. 
    3. If necessary, the group leader will collaborate with the group to redistribute tasks and responsibilities to minimize disruptions to the assignment.

4. Different Standard of Quality of Work
   Group members may have differing standards for the quality of work, leading to disputes over what is acceptable, the following steps will be taken:
    1. Define quality standards: At the project's start, set clear quality benchmarks and criteria for assessment. This can help align expectations. 
    2. Peer review: Encourage group members to review each other's work before submission, ensuring that it meets the established quality standards. 
    3. Constructive feedback: If concerns about the quality of someone's work arise, provide specific, constructive feedback rather than criticism.
